# Identical_PDF_check
Develop a program using PDF Miner to identify variations between PDF documents, then present the distinctions as HTML documents.

# Installation

pip install pdfminer

# How To Use

Run a script, pdf_difference.py, via the terminal. 
The script allows you to select source and target PDF files. 
It provides options for an output HTML file path and a margin value. 
After setting these options, you can click the "PDF Diff" button to compare the selected PDF files. 
Upon completion, a pop-up message will indicate the success of the comparison. 
You can then choose to select another set of files to compare or close the application.
